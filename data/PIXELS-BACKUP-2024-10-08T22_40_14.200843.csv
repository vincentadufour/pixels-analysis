Prompted by videos of Quebecians, and wondering if I would've ended up working there, maybe I'd be there right now after some time in AU. I'm not sure. I sat on the staircase up to the top floor of the big house hoping Marley would come out so I could confide in her, lol. I need someone to talk to. Someone outside of my circle. New friends maybe.\nAlso found myself dangerous relieved imagining a world where I was a widow - it solves the problem of hurting everyone around me for a selfish reason (if I left Madeline), I'd still get to see the bristol fam and be very very close with them, but it would also allow me to now lead my own life as practically the only decision -maker, and ""start"". Maybe even date new people too. \nOf course, those are the sweet bits. In reality that option is overflowing with lifelong pain and regret.\nWhat are my options? If I'm always kicking rocks about not having stood up for myself, when will I? You bastard. Hypocrite. All day you've been thinking, ""if you won't do something now, when? If you won't do it today, you are never doing it."" - the radicalized version of, ""what you do today defines the kind of life you live"".

It brought back all these old feelings of anger and spite. Honestly disgust too. I don't really feel like they're good people. Or very intelligent people. From what I know about them (which is both a lot and nothing at all), they're not the kinds of people I want in my life. One of the biggest reasons being they're incredibly bad at being thoughtful to the people around them.

"2024-6-16","Mood","5","","","Holy shit productive day!!! I did all the things below (sent to Madeline as a message) and played Manor Lords and League in the evening\n\n- cleaned up Athena's pee on some clothes in the bathroom\n- did some laundry (whites & colored batches)\n- Fed Mr. Spoon (it took him like 15 minutes to eat a chick because he kept trying to eat it vertically and it wasn't working)\n- Vacuumed the hallway and both of our bedrooms\n- Fit my blanket with the new duvet cover\n- Changed out a few full trash bins downstairs\n- Did my dishes upstairs\n- Cleaned both of our heavy duty air filters\n- Helped Bree with her discrete structures hw, helped her solve a proof by contradiction\n- Added 16 Kanban cards for upcoming homework/quizzes (this was important because it meant learning what the motion of each class was going to be coming up, now I have a better understanding of them and feel less overwhelmed)\n- E-mailed my chem professor requesting a timeline for the quizzes (currently all due on Aug 3rd, asked her if she could give me a timeline so I could have something to try to stay on track with rather than just do it whenever u want, which is how the class currently is???)\n- Yoinked Wendy and Crane's fan to have it in my room cause it's WAY too damn hot in here (I'll return it if they say they want it, but hopefully I can buy my own once the van is back and before they ask for it back)\n- Cut a hole in our zipper door to allow airflow (keeping track of if it helps by checking how much power Mr. Spoon's bulb needs to maintain 80F. Before the airhole and the fan, it was at 9% power to maintain 80F.)\n- Now about to work on digitizing some CDs from my parent's house, Ecole Hoffet homemade movies"
