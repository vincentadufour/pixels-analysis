Prompted by videos of Quebecians, and wondering if I would've ended up working there, maybe I'd be there right now after some time in AU. I'm not sure. I sat on the staircase up to the top floor of the big house hoping Marley would come out so I could confide in her, lol. I need someone to talk to. Someone outside of my circle. New friends maybe.\nAlso found myself dangerous relieved imagining a world where I was a widow - it solves the problem of hurting everyone around me for a selfish reason (if I left Madeline), I'd still get to see the bristol fam and be very very close with them, but it would also allow me to now lead my own life as practically the only decision -maker, and \"start\". Maybe even date new people too. \nOf course, those are the sweet bits. In reality that option is overflowing with lifelong pain and regret.\nWhat are my options? If I'm always kicking rocks about not having stood up for myself, when will I? You bastard. Hypocrite. All day you've been thinking, \"if you won't do something now, when?

I feel like I'm kinda already there. But I have to tell her that and soon so it doesn't settle in before it's too late. Gotta tell her that the lack of physical intimacy means our relationship has been redefined already, we just haven't caught up in our labels, and if we want to redefine it, we have to start therapy asap. Otherwise like, we are just roommates, and esp with my feelings for Mikayla I feel like I cannot tell her I have a partner because somewhere I don't think it's true.

I wonder if this guy friend she brings up sometimes and has a photo of their chars as her background is a boyfriend of some sort? Not sure yet. We walked to the lego store together and talked in there and it was super fun, I love hearing her get all excited and she's so beautiful when she's smiling and also when she's got a neutral face and is looking at her phone. Her nose is really cute. I like her a lot tbh. There Are some moments that turn me off a bit, like when she gets annoyed really fast and when she tried to get out of the way quickly last weekend and it looked a bit silly lol. But despite those she is beautiful and really cool. I sat in front of her at the Indian place and she's pretty quiet - just likes to listen and laugh from time to time. Taher monopolized the conversation which was weird but also not that big a deal. Derek drove me home and I wished I could've just kept hanging out with Mikayla. I sent her a message asking if she'd like to go to dinner or a tea shop with me before she went back home, I saw her turn online so she probably read it? But she did not respond yet. Hopefully I wake up to a message cause no response then seeing her at work would be a lil insanely awkward and I'd die I think.

I'm really fucking hoping nothing comes up cause that would be my last chance and I really want that time with her if I can get it. I daydreamed a Lot today about kissing her. I came home and hour later than usual just spending time working next to her, in the rain and dark skies. Madeline and I watched Adventures of Priscilla together and it was super super good, very fun time actually.

God dude, my mouth was so fucking dry but I wanted to touch her face and her neck and her waist and I wanted to kiss her. I told her how I was so surprised she's never dated anyone because she's so beautiful and hearing her do little gasps then giggle was really really cute - she was smiling so much lol. Anyways I came home and felt horrible that I had done something I shouldn't have done - I tried to talk to her but she was too sleepy so she said no which I love, boundaries are dope, then I talked to Madeline and bawled a lot. It was a very good conversation and honestly I think a really good first step towards potentially splitting up. There were a lot of conversations about redefining and what if we weren't romantically entangled and stuff like that. I still have to talk to Mikayla and I feel so horrible about that. I feel gutted.

I said that isn't immediately a deal breaker, and that idk what my life is gonna look like in a year so we'd just have to see then. Then we talked about Elden Ring and Minecraft and w/e for like almost 2 hours. Came home feeling pretty okay, finally somewhat hungry, ate some food. Madeline is sick but also before going to bed she admitted to me she's feeling angry and hurt by me thinking about breaking up. She also told me she wouldn't feel comfortable with me dating Mikayla before making a decision on whether or not I want to stay with her. I told her that's fair and that I wasn't planning on dating Mikayla right now. I tried masturbating and it felt good but was also pretty rough. Feeling horrible emotionally.

Like dump him he's horrible kinda stuff. They almost left the group chats. I talked with Madeline and she told me that stuff as small as holding her hands has been too much, hugging her has been too much, compliments about her body have been too much. I asked her what was happening in the situations where I'd check in and ask if she's comfortable with me complimenting her body and her saying yes - and she said she'd lie because she didn't know what else to say. I understand she was scared. I also don't know what I was supposed to do if she's saying yes she's okay with something and she isn't. I already changed the boundaries on my own when coming back from Laos realizing something was off, but now that she has expressly said any physical contact is traumatic, I am going nuclear and not touching her ever unless she asks me to and it'll have to be very very thoroughly thought out consent, especially very enthusiastic consent. I didn't even help her up because I couldn't trust her that she was okay with me holding her hand. Froggy dipped out of playing League because they don't want to play with me. I feel terrified they are going to go scorched earth and never like me again. I realize Madeline told them the extreme and they went to the extreme. At this point, I am no longer unsure of whether or not something is hard for Madeline but she wants me to keep doing it to build a positive conditioning, I now know that ANY physical touch is too much from me. In a way that itself is a relief, I will not hurt her with my presence and I will not be naked in front of her and I will not look at her naked nor go to the bathroom with the door open or anything like that. I know what to do and I'm sure it'll not cause her harm. 3 years ago she said no more sex and I agreed to help her heal. Every moment of physical touch I've had since then has been filled with fear that I'm hurting her. Now I know I was even though I was being careful not to, so I cannot ever touch her again. Not unless we both independently and together get a lot of therapy. I'll be honest this is awful. I am fighting so so hard to keep away the feelings of being a monster. I didn't ever mean to hurt her; I have cared so much this whole time, I didn't know I was hurting her. I could've done better to be more proactive. I need therapy to see if I am bad at seeing this kind of thing maybe. I don't know. Froggy hating me is one of the worst feelings I've ever felt and I could not bare it if Marley hated me. Madeline has said she won't go into details with Marley and I hope that is true because it's hard not to feel like I will be defenseless and Marley might scorch earth me too. I don't know. I really did not know. I thought I was being so careful. I decided to go another step before any of this blew up. Please god this is awful.","tags":[]},{"date":"2025-7-30","type":"Mood","scores":[1],"notes":"The agony continues but so do I. Panic attack during Sprint planning at work. Felt sick to my stomach all day. Froggy left me a VM which felt comforting and allowed me to explain myself. Had a very good walk and talk with Madeline in the evening that felt pretty normal and was very helpful for feeling connected. Got overwhelmed by RL1 Elden Ring. Had a nice laying down cum into sock moment. Stopped looking at my phone and just thought of Mikayla if I'm being honest.","tags":[]},{"date":"2025-7-31","type":"Mood","scores":[2],"notes":"Man the dread persists. Honestly I'm just scared of what will happen. I don't want to lose Marley and Cameron. I don't want to lose Marley holy shit. I don't wanna lose anyone in this at all esp since they're So regulating to me. I do Not want to lose Madeline omfg. That is absolutely the worst thought ever. But how can we heal from this? And don't I need to anyways? Also a big part of my dread is that I miss Mikayla. Does she think about me like I think about her? Does she hate me bc of what I had kept from her? She had said it was alright and that she understood but like does she still feel that way? It's hard to know for sure. I wish I could talk to her more","tags":[]},{"date":"2025-8-1","type":"Mood","scores":[3,4,1],"notes":"Day was pretty okay, felt somewhat regulated, kinda just drowned myself all day. Moved furniture around to have my own room which was nice. Kidz night was also fun for me - Marley, Madeline, and I went to HK Station which was super delish and then watched both Black Bag AND KPOP Demon Hunters.  Madeline wasn't doing good at all at the restaurant and started doing a lot better after the movies started. After I dropped Marley off, Madeline and I talked some more which was a hard conversation. I got angry because she was insinuating I did everything wrong and she had nothing to apologize for, also learned how much I am source of truth for her and am realizing I need to back off. This feels pretty cooked tbh. This is a really hard thing. If we make it through this we will be insanely strong but also this could definitely be the end of us. I cannot leave this relationship on bad terms though, I cannot leave while she is still trying to figure out what happened. That would be too difficult to leave open ended like that. I want us to figure out what happened and then heal together, and Then see how the relationship feels.","tags":[]},{"date":"2025-8-2","type":"Mood","scores":[3],"notes":"Actually not a horrible day! I woke up and Had to do some journaling and research about morality and so I did and then wrote Madeline a big email which felt good.

Had some quality alone time and don't you know it I fell in love with a certain Maria on Sky: Children of the Light that I met for like 40 minutes of trying to communicate in Spanish & English, then when our bench candle ran out we just ran around and held hands and flew around and then she disconnected - to be continued later I guess?
